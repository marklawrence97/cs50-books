# Project 1

My Solution to cs50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript Project 1.

This is a simple flask app that implements a rudimentary log in method using sessions, and then allows a user to write a review on any of the 5000 books stored in the database.

A user can also update thier review and view other user's reviews on the book.

This project is hosted by Heroku at:

I am using a free dyno to host, this dyno sleeps after 30 minutes of inactivity - so will likely to a short while to start up!
