# Project 1

My Solution to cs50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript Project 1.

This is a simple flask app that implements a rudimentary log in method using sessions, and then allows a user to write a review on any of the 5000 books stored in the database.

A user can also update a review and view other user's reviews on the books.
